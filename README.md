This repo is intended to provide the contents of a FreeBSD ports tree leaf: /usr/ports/games/minetestmapper-dev so that those who desire may obtain and build their own.  This will follow the github repo with updates as frequent as I am able, tied to commits there.  My commits to be ONE day behind in order to avoid multiple commits of the same date.

You may need this file: https://nodecore.mine.nu/w/MinetestMapper_colors.txt appended to https://github.com/minetest/minetestmapper/blob/master/colors.txt

For the NCC server this works nicely:  --geometry -1024:-1024+2048+2048
